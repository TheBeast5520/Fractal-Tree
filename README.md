# Fractal-Tree

A code that creates a Fractal Tree.

change the variable 'n' to change the depth, that is, how many times it splits.
change the variable 'points' to control how 'dark' the image will be. The more points, the better you can see it, but the more time the program takes.
you can also change the 'baseAngle' and the 'randomFactor'
